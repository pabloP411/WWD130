        Welcome to my DIY vinyl wrap website! My goal is that you will learn how to wrap your own vehicles with vinyl. Vinyl wrapping is more than just about looks; it can also be about protecting the original paint job of a car. Vinyl should be the #1 modification added to a vehicle because it can not only protect the paint from scratches, small dents, and chips. It also makes it easier to wash your car. It can be a little more expensive, but some vinyl can “reheal” itself from scratches, making the paint appear new for much longer. Here I will teach you the basics of applying vinyl, the materials needed, and tips I have learned in my own experiences using vinyl wrap. 
I hope all you DIY enthusiasts out there will use this site as a resource for your own vinyl wrap experiences. Check out my videos that give tutorials on how to complete your wrap projects!  I will show you the work I have done on different parts of a vehicle, including the rear lights, on top of the cab, and surrounding the grille area. My current videos don’t show exactly what you were hoping for? Use my contact feature to send in requests, questions, and comments for me to respond to in future videos and photo tutorials.

      <h3>Wrap Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Before you begin, make sure you have some background knowledge on how to use the tools you will need and where to purchase the necessary materials. 
        Also, be patient! Vinyl wrap is a very delicate, tricky product to work with. Applying vinyl will also require more than one person to be involved in the process. 
        Remember to take things slow as you complete every step. Vinyl is a very temperamental product, and mistakes and failures will happen while applying it. 
        It is part of the learning process. Please don’t expect perfect results the first time, keep trying out the methods, and take breaks away from the vinyl application. 
        Knowing these things will help put you on the right path to modifying your vehicles in the right way.

      <h3>Sharing For Free</h3>
      <p>
        I am happy to provide this website as a free service to others-  I hope this appeals to all who visit my site and prefer it over others! I do not charge anyone to ask questions, 
        request help with techniques, or give advice. I share my experiences from failures and successes without charging a fee. 
        You will also find that I have an open message board on this site to allow others to share their opinions. There will be things I don’t know and cannot answer. 
        I do not pretend to be an expert, only someone who has knowledge and experience I am willing to share. I am aware that there are others out there with much more experience, 
        and I would like to create a virtual hub for amateurs and professionals alike to mingle their ideas together. My goal is to create an online community for everyone to enjoy and learn from each other.
