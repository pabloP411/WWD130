        People will come to my website for the purpose of learning how to wrap their own vehicles in vinyl. Vinyl wrapping is more than just about looks; it can also be about protecting the original paint job of a car. Vinyl should be the #1 modification added to a vehicle because it can not only protect the paint from scratches, small dents, and chips. It also makes it easier to wash your car. It can be a little more expensive, but some vinyl can “reheal” itself from scratches, making the paint appear new for much longer. Those who visit my site will learn the basics of applying vinyl, the materials needed, and tips I have learned in my own experiences using vinyl wrap. 
My goal is that vehicle DIY enthusiasts will use my site as a resource for their own vinyl wrap experiences. I will provide videos that give visual and audio steps for how to complete their wrap projects. Videos will showcase the vinyl work I have down on different parts of a vehicle, including on the rear lights, on top of the cab, and surrounding the grille. I’ll also provide a contact feature where people who visit my site can send in requests, questions, and comments for me to respond to in future videos and photo tutorials.

      <h3>Wrap Basics</h3>
      <p>
        To understand and provide this information, it will be important that those who visit my site have a foundational knowledge. They should know how to use the tools, where to purchase the materials necessary, and have the mindset that they will need to be patient with themselves and the product. Applying vinyl will also require more than one person to be involved in the process. Along with being patient, vinyl wrap DIYers will not to take things slow, completing every step. Vinyl is a very temperamental product, and mistakes and failures will happen while applying it. It is part of the learning process. Those who visit my site should not expect perfect results the first time, keep trying out the methods, and take breaks away from the vinyl application. Knowing these things will put vinyl wrappers on the right path to modifying their vehicles in the right way. 
Some questions that those that come to my website will bring with them may include: 
•	What are the benefits and drawbacks to wrapping my car in vinyl?
•	How easy is it to apply vinyl wrap?
•	What materials should I purchase for wrapping my vehicle, including which tools and vinyl products?
•	How much time will it take to complete a wrap?
•	What are the basic steps to vinyl wrapping?

      <h3>Sharing For Free</h3>
      <p>
        [Visitors will come to my website instead of other websites because the information I would provide would be for free. 
        I would not charge patrons to ask questions, request help with certain techniques, or giving advice. 
        I would be sharing my experiences from failures and successes without requiring compensation. 
        I will also open it up for others to give their opinions in an open message board. There will be things I don’t know and cannot answer. 
        I do not pretend to be an expert, only someone who has knowledge and experience I am willing to share. 
        I am aware that there are others out there with much more experience, and I would like to create a virtual hub for amateurs and professionals alike to mingle their ideas together. 
        My goal is to create an online community for everyone to enjoy and learn from each other.
